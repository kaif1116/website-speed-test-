<h1>How Hosting Affects Website Speed</h1>

<p>Many website owners focus only on design and content, but hosting is one of the strongest technical factors behind performance. Understanding how hosting affects website speed helps you make smarter decisions without overspending.</p>

<p>You can check your current performance using our <a href="../index.html">Free Website Speed Test Tool</a>.</p>

<h2>What Is Web Hosting?</h2>

<p>Web hosting is the service that stores your website files and delivers them to users through servers. When someone visits your site, the server processes the request and sends back the page.</p>

<h2>Server Response Time</h2>

<p>Server response time is the delay between a browser request and the first byte of data received. Slow hosting increases this delay.</p>

<h2>Types of Hosting and Speed Impact</h2>

<h3>Shared Hosting</h3>
<p>Shared hosting places many websites on the same server. It is affordable but performance can fluctuate.</p>

<h3>VPS Hosting</h3>
<p>Virtual Private Servers offer more stable resources and improved speed.</p>

<h3>Cloud Hosting</h3>
<p>Cloud hosting distributes traffic across multiple servers, improving reliability and scalability.</p>

<h2>Hosting Location and Latency</h2>

<p>Server location affects how quickly data travels to users. Global audiences benefit from hosting with CDN support.</p>

<h2>Hosting and SEO</h2>

<p>Search engines favor fast, reliable sites. Hosting directly influences page speed SEO signals.</p>

<p>This connects closely with our guide on <a href="page-speed-seo.html">page speed SEO</a> and <a href="website-speed-guide.html">website speed optimization</a>.</p>
